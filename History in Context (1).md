# Knowledge in Context
The most [interesting annotation](https://hyp.is/EnyecmKmEeeg7msSkmp5_Q/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) I saw was written by sarahmcole. In the piece on *Open Notebook History* written by Caleb McDaniel, she notes how sharing notes between historians would enrich the field, and that seeing how an individual arrived at different ideas might add crucial context, which is imperative when studying history. Having the ability to see specific points of historical context and how they were interpreted and formed into ideas and arguments would present crucial insight into the study of the topic.

Caleb McDaniel notes that unlike the reproducible experiments of scientists, open notes for historians are more to prove that ["historical arguments are on a fundamental level irreproducible."](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html#annotations:EnyecmKmEeeg7msSkmp5_Q) As such, the context behind how each historian came to realize his or her own point of view is required for other historians to see how exactly their arguments and findings came to be. If we had the ability to view the notes of every historian throughout history, our knowledge of the people, places and events that were being written about would increase dramatically. Additionally, this same context would no doubt be interpreted by others differently as well, leading to more conclusions and in turn a greater understanding of the topic at hand. [Michelle Moravec wrote an interesting post on the concept of opening up notes to the public, wherein she described the isolation of the individual and knowledge in academia.](http://michellemoravec.com/michelle-moravec/) There is a plethora of knowledge that individuals sift through to create an actual paper or report, and most of it is left out and never recorded. This context, all of the background knowledge that is crucial in trying to understand how ideas and arguments come to be, would to a large extent serve to enrich the field and study of history. 

This [article](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-historical-context-1857069) titled *The Importance of Historical Context in Analysis and Interpretation* gives important insight into how crucial specific context is in contributing to the narrative of a historian. How one interprets and chooses to present their individual analysis of context translates into their own individual version, or narrative, of the story. The University of Minnesota describes the importance of ["paying close attention to the people who produced it, the time in which they worked, what was going on at that time, and how what was going on may have influenced the production."](https://www.lib.umn.edu/bell/Historical%20Context) While this quote was dealing with analyzing historical sources, it is just as relevant in describing what might be gained through the use of open notes. These bits of context would help future readers to understand where the historian was coming from, and in turn help to further the study of the topic through different interpretations of the same source data.
